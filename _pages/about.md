Hello! I am an Economics PhD student at Stanford with a minor in Computer Science. Prior to that, I was a research analyst at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research, under the supervision of Matthew Gentzkow. I hold a BSc in Economics from University College London.<br /> 

I deeply believe that we can create a better world through guided technological progress and informed mechanism design. <br> I am interested in growth, labour economics, behavioural economics, economic inequality, and child cognitive development. I am also interested in AI alignment and how the deployment of AI technologies will affect our economies.<br />

A deep goal of mine is to create a world where all children have access to the same opportunities. I deeply believe in the power of education in reducing intergenerational inequality. In light of this, I am a main contributor to the [Core-Econ Project](https://www.core-econ.org/), a free online textbook with a mission to reform the teaching of economics and empirical research in college. <br />

Another issue close to my heart is that of refugees, and in particular, child refugees. I have spent a lot of time in Lebanon and Colombia, two countries where external refugees and internal displacement affect many children.<br>
I worked with UNHCR to develop [ConnectingWorlds](https://www.unhcr.org/us/get-involved/take-action/welcome-connecting-worlds), an app that gives supporters and refugees a space to share experiences and gain insight into each other's lives. I also developed my own platform, [kara.co](http://kara.co), that aims to facilitate cross-border charity donations. The platform is still in beta version, but donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you want to join in the next round, or if you have some feedback!<br />
