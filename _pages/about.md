Hello!

I am a second year Economics PhD student at Stanford, with a minor in Computer Science.  I deeply believe that we can create a better world through guided technological progress and informed mechanism design. I conduct research in labor economics, and economic inequality. One of my main focus is the impact that AI technologies will have on the labor market, structural organization of society, political outcomes and human interactions. 

My research heavily relies on econometrics and Bayesian statistics to interpret the world, emphasizing the role of causal inference and proper experimental design. I am a recipient of the Stanford EDGE fellowship and also received a special scholarship from the King Mohamed VI of Morocco for Bright Academic Research. Â 


I am a member of the Stanford AI Alignment group where I conduct research in AI safety, to ensure the development of advanced AI will be safe and beneficial for all. My projects include providing new scalable solutions to tackle goal misgeneralization, as well as designing new evaluation methods for detecting deceptive capabilities in LLM. 

One of my goals is to ensure that research findings are translated into actionable policy strategies. I thus engage regularly with policy stakeholders in AI. I am a Paragon AI Policy fellow, and work with the state of California to inform and implement a new policy plan for Deepfake enforcement. 

Before joining Stanford, I was a research fellow at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research, where I managed multiple research projects relating to the societal impact of social media, under the supervision of Matthew Gentzkow. I also previously worked as a cross-assets analyst at JP Morgan, where I conducted macroeconomic research across various emerging markets, designed investment strategies and developed predictive models. 

I'm passionate about applying my skills in experimental design and behavioral economics to explore how technology and economic mechanisms can drive positive global change. I founded [kara.co](http://kara.co/), a platform for cross-border charity donations, and also regularly implement programs with UNHCR. You can learn more about these personal projects on my website. 

On a personal note, I am [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers), originally from Morocco. I speak 6 languages, and I love Russian literature.
