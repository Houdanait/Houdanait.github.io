Hello! I am an Economics PhD student at Stanford with a minor in Computer Science. Prior to that, I was a research analyst at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research, under the supervision of Matthew Gentzkow. I hold a BSc in Economics from University College London.<br /> 

I deeply believe that we can create a better world through guided technological progress and informed mechanism design. I love to interpret the world using econometrics and Bayesian statistics. 

My research interests are labour economics, causal inference, experimental design, economic inequality, behavioural economics and economic inequality. I am also interested in AI alignment and how the deployment of AI technologies will affect our economies.Â <br />
