I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research working with Professor Matthew Gentzkow.<br />
Prior to that, I was a trader in the Emerging Markets fixed-income desk at JP Morgan in London.<br /> 
I hold a Bsc in Economics from University College London.<br /> 

I am interested in studying the behavior and dynamics of small entities within large complex systems.
My research interests encompass financial markets and debt sustainability as well as environmental economics, social networks and human capital theory. <br />

I am a contributor to the [Core-Econ Project](https://www.core-econ.org/). <br />
