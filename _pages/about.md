I am an Economics PhD student at Stanford with a minor in Computer Science. Prior to that, I was a research analyst at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research, under the supervision of Matthew Gentzkow. I hold a Bsc in Economics from University College London.<br /> 

I am interested in labour economics, behavioural economics and child cognitive development. I am also interested about AI alignment and how deployment of AI technologies will affect our economies. <br />

I am a contributor to the [Core-Econ Project](https://www.core-econ.org/). <br />
