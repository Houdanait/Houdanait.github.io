I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research working with Professor Matthew Gentzkow. Prior to that, I was a trader in the Emerging Markets fixed-income desk at JP Morgan in London.
I hold a Bsc in Economics from University College London.<br /> 

I am interested in studying the behavior of small entities and their dynamics within large complex systems.
My research interests lie in financial markets, debt sustainability, environmental economics, social networks and human capital theory. <br />

I am a contributor to the [Core-Econ Project](https://www.core-econ.org/). <br />
