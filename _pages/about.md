I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research working with Professor Matthew Gentzkow. 
Prior to that, I was a trader in the Emerging Markets Debt desk at JP Morgan London. I hold a BSc. in Economics from University College London. 

My research is motivated by the desire to understand the sources of economic disparities at both the macroscopic and microscopic scale. My interests lie in debt sustainability, monetary policy and the dynamics of financial markets. 
I am also interested in studying the behavior of agents within complex systems for public policy. I am looking at applications in environmental economics, social networks and human capital theory. 
I am a contributor to the [Core-Econ Project](https://www.core-econ.org/).
