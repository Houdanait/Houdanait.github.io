I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research working with Professor Matthew Gentzkow.<br />
Prior to that, I was a trader in the Emerging Markets Debt desk at JP Morgan London.<br /> 
I hold a BSc. in Economics from University College London.<br /> 

I am interested in studying the behavior of small entities within large omplex systems.
My research interests lie in the dynamics of financial markets, debt sustainability as well as environmental economics, social networks and human capital theory. <br />

I am a contributor to the [Core-Econ Project](https://www.core-econ.org/). <br />
